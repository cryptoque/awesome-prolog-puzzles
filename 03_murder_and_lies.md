# Murder at the Tycoon’s Mansion: A Puzzle of Lies

A wealthy tycoon was found murdered in his mansion.

On the day of the murder, only four people visited the tycoon’s house. Each came alone, and none has an alibi strong enough to clear their name.

The police interrogated all four suspects. Each suspect gave two statements during questioning:

## Suspect Statements
A: “None of us four killed the tycoon.”
“The tycoon was still alive when I left his house.”

B: “I was the second person to visit the tycoon that day.”
“When I arrived, the tycoon was already dead.”

C: “I was the third person to visit the tycoon.”
“The tycoon was still alive when I left.”

D: “The killer did not leave after I visited the house.”
“When I arrived, the tycoon was already dead.”

## The Twist
It was later discovered that every single statement made by these four suspects was a lie.
With this knowledge, can you figure out, who killed the tycoon?
