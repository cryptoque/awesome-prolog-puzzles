# Awesome Prolog for Logic Puzzles

If you're tired of bloated code and fuzzy logic, this is your antidote. Logic puzzles can get messy. In Prolog, they don‚Äôt.

This is where clarity wins and puzzles solve themselves, once you state the rules right. Turns out, when the logic is right, the code is short.

Logic programming flips the usual mindset: you don‚Äôt tell the computer how to solve the puzzle, you tell it what must be true. The rest is just inference.

This is a collection of logic puzzles modeled in Prolog, demonstrating the power of logic programming for solving complex reasoning problems. Each puzzle includes a markdown description and a fully working prolog solution (".pl").
