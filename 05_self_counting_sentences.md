# The Sentence That Counts Itself

## Problem
Fill in the blanks of this sentence with the correct digits (0–9) so that the whole sentence describes itself accurately:

> “In this sentence,  
>  the digit 0 appears _ times,  
>  the digit 1 appears _ times,  
>  the digit 2 appears _ times,  
>  the digit 3 appears _ times,  
>  the digit 4 appears _ times,  
>  the digit 5 appears _ times,  
>  the digit 6 appears _ times,  
>  the digit 7 appears _ times,  
>  the digit 8 appears _ times,  
>  the digit 9 appears _ times.”

Every blank must be filled with an **Arabic numeral (0–9)** so that each statement in the sentence is true.

Can you find the unique set of digits that makes this sentence perfectly self-descriptive?  

## Solution

See [`05_self_counting_sentences.pl`](05_self_counting_sentences.pl) for the Prolog implementation.
