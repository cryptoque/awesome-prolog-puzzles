# The Hidden Number

## Problem
A picks one of the numbers below.
A then tells **the value** to B and **the color** to C.

1 (white), 1 (red), 2 (green), 3 (green), 4 (red), 4 (green), 4 (blue), 5 (white),
5 (blue), 6 (blue), 7 (green), 8 (green), 10 (green), 11 (red), 11 (blue), 12 (blue)

After looking at the numbers, B and C have the following conversation:

B: I don’t know which number A has picked.
C: I don’t either, but I knew you didn’t.
B: I now know which it is.
C: So do I.

Find the number A chose.

## Solution

See [`01_the_hidden_number.pl`](01_the_hidden_number.pl) for the Prolog implementation.
