# The Sleeping Price and the Seven Dwarfs

A prince has been cursed by a witch and lies in a deep sleep for thousands of years. To awaken him, he must be fed a **delicious apple**.  

In a faraway forest live **seven dwarfs**: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Black, and White.  
Each dwarf is holding an apple.  

**Constraints:**  
- Honest dwarfs hold **delicious apples**.  
- Liar dwarfs hold **poisonous apples**.  
- To save the prince, you must identify which dwarfs are honest so you know whose apples are safe to feed him.  

The dwarfs made the following statements:  

---

### Red Dwarf:
> "The Black Dwarf is holding a delicious apple."

---

### Orange Dwarf:

> "I dug up a gold nugget!"  
> "There are exactly three delicious apples in total."

---

### Yellow Dwarf:
> "The Orange Dwarf and I are the same type of person."

---

### Green Dwarf:
> "The weather on the mountain is unpredictable. It even rained heavily yesterday!"  

---

### Blue Dwarf:
> "The White Dwarf and I are not the same type of person."

---

### Black Dwarf:
> "The Green Dwarf and I are not the same type of person."

---

### White Dwarf:
> "The Red Dwarf is holding a delicious apple."
